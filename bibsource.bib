  abstract = {Background: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of skin delivers three-dimensional images of tissue microstructures. Although OCT imaging offers a promising high-resolution modality, OCT images suffer from some artifacts that lead to misinterpretation of tissue structures. Therefore, an overview of methods to mitigate artifacts in OCT imaging of the skin is of paramount importance. Speckle, intensity decay, and blurring are three major artifacts in OCT images. Speckle is due to the low coherent light source used in the configuration of OCT. Intensity decay is a deterioration of light with respect to depth, and blurring is the consequence of deficiencies of optical components. Method: Two speckle reduction methods (one based on artificial neural network and one based on spatial compounding), an attenuation compensation algorithm (based on Beer-Lambert law) and a deblurring procedure (using deconvolution), are described. Moreover, optical properties extraction algorithm based on extended Huygens-Fresnel (EHF) principle to obtain some additional information from OCT images are discussed. Results: In this short overview, we summarize some of the image enhancement algorithms for OCT images which address the abovementioned artifacts. The results showed a significant improvement in the visibility of the clinically relevant features in the images. The quality improvement was evaluated using several numerical assessment measures. Conclusion: Clinical dermatologists benefit from using these image enhancement algorithms to improve OCT diagnosis and essentially function as a noninvasive optical biopsy. \textcopyright{} 2017 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.

  abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) reconstructs the scattering potential of a sample with spatially invariant resolution, based on the incident beam profile, the beam scan pattern, the physical model of light sample interaction, and subsequent light collection by the system. In practice, aberrations may influence the beam profile, particularly at higher NA, when ISAM is expected to provide maximum benefit over optical coherence microscopy. Thus it is of interest to determine the effects of aberrations on ISAM reconstructions. In this paper we present the forward model incorporating the effects of aberrations, which forms the basis for aberration correction in ISAM. Simulations and experimental results show that when operating far from focus, modest amounts of spherical aberration can introduce artifacts to the point-spread function, even at relatively low NA   0.1-0.2. Further work will investigate computational methods to correct the effects of aberrations, i.e. to perform virtual adaptive optics. \textcopyright{} 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM), a computed imaging technique to overcome the depth-of-field limitations in optical coherence tomography/microscopy (OCT/OCM), is utilized to correct defocus and reveal local high-scattering regions that can serve as potential guide stars. The correction of pupil aberrations using Zernike polynomials can be applied pre- or post-ISAM in order to improve resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of these guide stars. Aberrations of the effective pupil function can then be determined through subsequent windowing and Fourier transforming of a guide star signal. Computational adaptive optics based on guide stars is demonstrated in a phantom consisting of sub-resolution scatterers, with work underway to extend this method to biological tissues. \textcopyright{} OSA 2012.},

  abstract = {Aberrations in optical microscopy reduce image resolution and contrast, and can limit imaging depth when focusing into biological samples. Static correction of aberrations may be achieved through appropriate lens design, but this approach does not offer the flexibility of simultaneously correcting aberrations for all imaging depths, nor the adaptability to correct for sample-specific aberrations for high-quality tomographic optical imaging. Incorporation of adaptive optics (AO) methods have demonstrated considerable improvement in optical image contrast and resolution in noninterferometric microscopy techniques, as well as in optical coherence tomography. Here we present a method to correct aberrations in a tomogram rather than the beam of a broadband optical interferometry system. Based on Fourier optics principles, we correct aberrations of a virtual pupil using Zernike polynomials. When used in conjunction with the computed imaging method interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy, this computational AO enables object reconstruction (within the single scattering limit) with ideal focal-plane resolution at all depths. Tomographic reconstructions of tissue phantoms containing subresolution titanium-dioxide particles and of ex vivo rat lung tissue demonstrate aberration correction in datasets acquired with a highly astigmatic illumination beam. These results also demonstrate that imaging with an aberrated astigmatic beam provides the advantage of a more uniform depth-dependent signal compared to imaging with a standard Gaussian beam. With further work, computational AO could enable the replacement of complicated and expensive optical hardware components with algorithms implemented on a standard desktop computer, making high-resolution 3D interferometric tomography accessible to a wider group of users and nonspecialists.},

These results demonstrate ISAM with computational aberration correction in highly scattering tissue. They also demonstrate that with precise high-speed scanning, volumetric ISAM can be performed without phase noise correction, and suggest that with GPU-based processing, real-time volumetric ISAM is feasible. \textcopyright{} 2012.},

  abstract = {Adaptive optics (AO) can shape aberrated optical wavefronts to physically restore the constructive interference needed for high-resolution imaging. With access to the complex optical field, however, many functions of optical hardware can be achieved computationally, including focusing and the compensation of optical aberrations to restore the constructive interference required for diffraction-limited imaging performance. Holography, which employs interferometric detection of the complex optical field, was developed based on this connection between hardware and computational image formation, although this link has only recently been exploited for 3D tomographic imaging in scattering biological tissues. This talk will present the underlying imaging science behind computational image formation with optical coherence tomography (OCT)-a beam-scanned version of broadband digital holography. Analogous to hardware AO (HAO), we demonstrate computational adaptive optics (CAO) and optimization of the computed pupil correction in 'sensorless mode' (Zernike polynomial corrections with feedback from image metrics) or with the use of 'guide-stars' in the sample. We discuss the concept of an 'isotomic volume' as the volumetric extension of the 'isoplanatic patch' introduced in astronomical AO. Recent CAO results and ongoing work is highlighted to point to the potential biomedical impact of computed broadband interferometric tomography. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of HAO vs. CAO for the effective shaping of optical wavefronts, and highlight opportunities for hybrid approaches that synergistically combine the unique advantages of hardware and computational methods for rapid volumetric tomography with cellular resolution. \textcopyright{} 2016 SPIE.},

  abstract = {High-resolution real-time tomography of scattering tissues is important for many areas of medicine and biology. However, the compromise between transverse resolution and depth-of-field, in addition to low sensitivity deep in tissue, continues to impede progress towards cellular-level volumetric tomography. Computed imaging has the potential to solve these long-standing limitations. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy is a computed imaging technique enabling high-resolution volumetric tomography with spatially invariant resolution. However, its potential for clinical diagnostics remains largely untapped because full volume reconstructions required lengthy post-processing, and the phase-stability requirements have been difficult to satisfy in vivo. Here, we demonstrate how three-dimensional Fourier-domain resampling, in combination with high-speed optical coherence tomography, can achieve high-resolution in vivo tomography. Enhanced depth sensitivity was achieved over a depth of field extended in real time by more than an order of magnitude. This work lays the foundation for high-speed volumetric cellular-level tomography. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The detected interferometric signals from multiple distinctive apertures were digitally refocused, which is analogous to synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Using numerical simulations and imaging experiments, we verified that this technique can maintain a diffraction-limited transverse resolution along a DOF that is {$\sim$}10 times larger than the confocal parameter.

  abstract = {High-resolution real-time tomography of biological tissues is important for many areas of biological investigations and medical applications. Cellular level optical tomography, however, has been challenging because of the compromise between transverse imaging resolution and depth-of-field, the system and sample aberrations that may be present, and the low imaging sensitivity deep in scattering tissues. The use of computed optical imaging techniques has the potential to address several of these long-standing limitations and challenges. Two related techniques are interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) and computational adaptive optics (CAO). Through three-dimensional Fourierdomain resampling, in combination with high-speed OCT, ISAM can be used to achieve high-resolution in vivo tomography with enhanced depth sensitivity over a depth-of-field extended by more than an order-of-magnitude, in realtime. Subsequently, aberration correction with CAO can be performed in a tomogram, rather than to the optical beam of a broadband optical interferometry system. Based on principles of Fourier optics, aberration correction with CAO is performed on a virtual pupil using Zernike polynomials, offering the potential to augment or even replace the more complicated and expensive adaptive optics hardware with algorithms implemented on a standard desktop computer. Interferometric tomographic reconstructions are characterized with tissue phantoms containing sub-resolution scattering particles, and in both ex vivo and in vivo biological tissue. This review will collectively establish the foundation for high-speed volumetric cellular-level optical interferometric tomography in living tissues. \textcopyright{} 2015 SPIE.},

OCT is the optical analog of ultrasound imaging, permitting tomographic imaging with micrometer-scale resolution, and with penetration depth of 1-3 mm in biological tissues. e success of OCT can be attributed in large part to the ideal match between imaging technology and the clinical requirements for imaging in the human eye. An excellent early review of the basic methods may be found in Ref. [6]. Within 15 years, OCT became an established imaging modality in ophthalmology [7,8], and to date has made signicant advances toward applications in cardiology [9], dermatology [10], and oncology [11]. \textcopyright{} 2013 by Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) is a noninvasive, cross-sectional imaging technique that measures depth resolved reflectance of tissue by Fourier transforming the spectral interferogram with the scanning of the reference avoided. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) is an optical microscopy computed-imaging technique for measuring the optical properties of biological tissues, which can overcome the compromise between depth of focus and transverse resolution. This paper describes the principle of SDOCT and ISAM, which multiplexes raw acquisitions to provide quantitatively meaningful data with reliable spatially invariant resolution at all depths. A mathematical model for a coherent microscope with a planar scanning geometry and spectral detection was described. The two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) of spectral data in the transverse directions was calculated. Then the nonuniform ISAM resampling and filtering was implemented to yield the scattering potential within the scalar model. Inverse FFT was used to obtain the ISAM reconstruction. One scatterer, multiple scatterers, and noisy simulations were implemented by use of ISAM to catch spatially invariant resolution. ISAM images were compared to those obtained using standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) methods. The high quality of the results validates the rationality of the founded model and that diffraction limited resolution can be achieved outside the focal plane. \textcopyright{} 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence microscopy (OCM) is an interferometric technique providing 3D images of biological samples with micrometric resolution and penetration depth of several hundreds of micrometers. OCM di ers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) in that it uses a high numerical aperture (NA) objective to achieve high lateral resolution. However, the high NA also reduces the depth-of-field (DOF), scaling with 1/NA2. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) is a computed imaging technique providing a solution to this trade-o between resolution and DOF. An alternative hardware method to achieve an extended DOF is to use a non-Gaussian illumination. Extended focus OCM (xfOCM) uses a Bessel beam to obtain a narrow and extended illumination volume. xfOCM detects back-scattered light using a Gaussian mode in order to maintain good sensitivity. However, the Gaussian detection mode limits the DOF. In this work, we present extended ISAM (xISAM), a method combining the benefits of both ISAM and xfOCM. xISAM uses the 3D coherent transfer function (CTF) to generalize the ISAM algorithm to di erent system configurations. We demonstrate xISAM both on simulated and experimental data, showing that xISAM attains a combination of high transverse resolution and extended DOF which has so far been unobtainable through conventional ISAM or xfOCM individually.

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical ranging technique analogous to radar - detection of back-scattered light produces a signal that is temporally localized at times-of-flight corresponding to the location of scatterers in the object. However the interferometric collection technique used in OCT allows, in principle, the coherent collection of data, i.e. amplitude and phase information can be extracted. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Microscopy (ISAM) adds phase-stable data collection to OCT instrumentation and employs physics-based processing analogous to that used in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). That is, the complex nature of the coherent data is exploited to give gains in image quality. Specifically, diffraction-limited resolution is achieved throughout the sample, not just within focal volume of the illuminating field. Simulated and experimental verifications of this effect are presented. ISAM's computational focusing obviates the trade-off between lateral resolution and depth-of-focus seen in traditional OCT. \textcopyright 2007 IEEE.},

Approximations to the model are developed for near-focus and far-from-focus operations. These approximations result in an image-reconstruction algorithm consistent with interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM): this validates ISAM processing of optical-coherence-tomography and optical-coherence-microscopy data in a vectorial setting. Numerical simulations confirm that diffraction-limited resolution can be achieved outside the focal plane and that depth of focus is limited only by measurement noise and/or detector dynamic range. Furthermore, the model presented is suitable for the quantitative study of polarimetric coherent microscopy systems operating within the first Born approximation. \textcopyright{} 2007 Optical Society of America.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional image formation in microscopy is greatly enhanced by the use of computed imaging techniques. In particular, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Microscopy (ISAM) allows the removal of out-of-focus blur in broadband, coherent microscopy. Earlier methods, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), utilize interferometric ranging, but do not apply computed imaging methods and therefore must scan the focal depth to acquire extended volumetric images. ISAM removes the need to scan the focus by allowing volumetric image reconstruction from data collected at a single focal depth. ISAM signal processing techniques are similar to the Fourier migration methods of seismology and the Fourier reconstruction methods of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In this article ISAM is described and the close ties between ISAM and SAR are explored. ISAM and a simple strip-map SAR system are placed in a common mathematical framework and compared to OCT and radar respectively. This article is intended to serve as a review of ISAM, and will be especially useful to readers with a background in SAR.},

  abstract = {OCT is a promising tool for performing fast and cheap noninvasive biopsies. High speed imaging helps to reduce motion artifacts that cause decreased sensitivity and resolution. Using a point scanning configuration one is ultimately limited in sensitivity. Therefore parallel configurations are a potentially attractive solution to further enhance the speed capabilities of future OCT systems. Even more, if full field configurations are employed one can exploit the intrinsic phase correlation over the field of view for digital wavefront correction techniques. Full field OCT has nevertheless limitations concerning the missing confocal gating. The sensitivity is decreased in the presence of specular reflexes from optical interfaces, furthermore light scattering cross talk between pixel causes additional signal degradation. A good compromise between parallel detection capabilities and confocal gating seems therefore line field OCT. We built a bench top line field system employing a frequency swept source enabling 2D/3D imaging at up to 200 kA-scans/s with an axial resolution of 8{$\mu$}m and a depth range of 3.53mm in air. To prevent specular reflexes reaching the line scan camera, an off axis configuration of the optical path together with spatial filters placed in conjugate planes of the system was used. Geometrical optics based digital refocusing through the full depth range was shown on a sample target containing FeO particles, on a biological sample and in vivo. Furthermore, we assessed the regime where line field has an advantage over point scanning OCT in terms of sensitivity. \textcopyright{} 2014 SPIE.},

LPSI is an imaging modality based on line-field swept source optical coherence tomography, which permits 3-D imaging at acquisition speeds of up to 1 MHz. The digital refocusing algorithm applies a defocus-correcting phase term to the Fourier representation of complex-valued interferometric image data, which is based on the geometrical optics information of the LPSI system. We introduce the off-axis LPSI system configuration, the digital refocusing algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for refocusing volumetric images of technical and biological samples. An increase of effective in-focus depth range from 255 m to 4.7 mm is achieved. The recovery of the full in-focus depth range might be especially valuable for future high-speed and high-resolution diagnostic applications of LPSI in ophthalmology. \textcopyright{} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {MHz OCT allows mitigating undesired influence of motion artifacts during retinal assessment, but comes in state-of-the-art point scanning OCT at the price of increased system complexity. By changing the paradigm from scanning to parallel OCT for in vivo retinal imaging the three-dimensional (3D) acquisition time is reduced without a trade-off between speed, sensitivity and technological requirements. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase stability allows for applying digital refocusing methods increasing the in-focus imaging depth range. Line field parallel interferometric imaging (LPSI) is utilizing a commercially available swept source, a single-axis galvo-scanner and a line scan camera for recording 3D data with up to 1MHz A-scan rate. Besides line-focus illumination and parallel detection, we mitigate the necessity for high-speed sensor and laser technology by holographic full-range imaging, which allows for increasing the imaging speed by low sampling of the optical spectrum. High B-scan rates up to 1kHz further allow for implementation of lable-free optical angiography in 3D by calculating the inter B-scan speckle variance. We achieve a detection sensitivity of 93.5 (96.5) dB at an equivalent A-scan rate of 1 (0.6) MHz and present 3D in vivo retinal structural and functional imaging utilizing digital refocusing. Our results demonstrate for the first time competitive imaging sensitivity, resolution and speed with a parallel OCT modality. LPSI is in fact currently the fastest OCT device applied to retinal imaging and operating at a central wavelength window around 800 nm with a detection sensitivity of higher than 93.5 dB. \textcopyright{} 2015 SPIE.},

Image improvement is achieved in the frequency domain where the echo phase can be adjusted to compensate for radial motion. The computational algorithm which determines motion parameters that reduce entropy to an absolute minimum is based on the golden-section-search method and operates in a closed-loop mode. Using this technique one can efficiently focus the image generated by a fully automated high-resolution-radar system that evaluates its own performance in terms of image quality.}

  abstract = {Holoscopy is a new imaging approach combining digital holography and full-field Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography. The interference pattern between light scattered by a sample and a defined reference wave is recorded and processed numerically. During reconstruction numerical refocusing is applied, overcoming the limitation of the focal depth and thus a uniform, diffraction limited lateral resolution over the whole measurement depth can be obtained. The advantage of numerical refocusing becomes especially significant for imaging at high numerical apertures (NAs). We use a high-resolution setup based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an high-resolution microscope objective (NA = 0.75). For reliable reconstruction of a sample volume the Rayleigh length of the microscope objective and the axial resolution, given by the spectral range of the light source, need to be matched. For a 0.75 NA objective a tunable light source with a sweeping range of ! 300nm is required. Here we present as a first step a tunable Ti:sapphire laser with a tuning range of 187 nm. By characterizing the spectral properties of the Ti:sapphire laser and determining the axial point spread function we demonstrate the feasibility of this light source for high-resolution holoscopy. \textcopyright{} 2013 Copyright SPIE.},

We present a noniterative digital aberration correction (DAC) to achieve aberration-free cellular-level resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the human retina in vivo. The system used is a line-field spectral-domain OCT system with a high tomogram rate, reaching 2.5\&\#x00A0;kHz. Such a high speed enables us to successfully apply digital aberration correction for not only imaging of human cone photoreceptors but also to obtain an aberration- and defocus-corrected 3D volume. Additionally, we apply DAC on functional OCT angiography data to improve lateral resolution and compensate for defocus. The speed necessities for the use of DAC in patient imaging are quantified by measuring the axial motion of 36 subjects. The first demonstration of DAC on OCT angiography as well as the motion analysis is important for future work dealing with DAC.},

Structures of different retinal layers, such as photoreceptors, capillaries, and nerve fibers are visualized with high resolution of 2.8 \&\#x00B5;m and 5.5 \&\#x00B5;m in lateral directions.

For this technique, algorithms are required that detect wavefront errors precisely and quickly. Here we propose an extension of the frequently used subaperture image correlation. By applying this algorithm iteratively and, more importantly, comparing each subaperture not to the central subaperture but to several randomly selected apertures, we improved aberration correction. Since these modifications only slightly increase the run time of the correction, we believe this method can become the algorithm of choice for many CAO applications. \textcopyright{} 2019 Optical Society of America.},

However, so far no imaging technique can generate entirely diffraction-limited tomographic volumes with a single data acquisition, if the target moves or changes rapidly, such as the human retina. Additionally, the presence of aberrations may represent further difficulties. We show that a simple interferometric setup\textendash based on parallelized optical coherence tomography\textendash acquires volumetric data with 10 billion voxels per second, exceeding previous imaging speeds by an order of magnitude. This allows us to computationally obtain and correct defocus and aberrations resulting in entirely diffraction-limited volumes.

Furthermore, the technique can also obtain phase-sensitive volumes of other scattering structures at unprecedented acquisition speeds.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized modern ophthalmology, providing depth resolved images of the retinal layers in a system that is suited to a clinical environment. Although the axial resolution of OCT system, which is a function of the light source bandwidth, is sufficient to resolve retinal features at a micrometer scale, the lateral resolution is dependent on the delivery optics and is limited by ocular aberrations. Through the combination of wavefront sensorless adaptive optics and the use of dual deformable transmissive optical elements, we present a compact lens-based OCT system at an imaging wavelength of 1060 nm for high resolution retinal imaging. We utilized a commercially available variable focal length lens to correct for a wide range of defocus commonly found in patient's eyes, and a novel multi-actuator adaptive lens for aberration correction to achieve near diffraction limited imaging performance at the retina. With a parallel processing computational platform, high resolution cross-sectional and en face retinal image acquisition and display was performed in real time. In order to demonstrate the system functionality and clinical utility, we present images of the photoreceptor cone mosaic and other retinal layers acquired in vivo from research subjects.},

  abstract = {Surgical microscopes are vital tools for ophthalmic surgeons. The recent development of an integrated OCT system for the first time allows to look at tissue features below the surface. Hence, these systems can drastically improve the quality and reduce the risk of surgical interventions. However, current commercial OCT-enhanced ophthalmic surgical microscopes provide only one additional cross sectional view to the standard microscope image and feature a low update rate. To present volumetric data at a high update rate, much faster OCT systems than the ones applied in today's surgical microscopes need to be developed. We demonstrate live volumetric retinal OCT imaging, which may provide a sufficiently large volume size (330x330x595 Voxel) and high update frequency (24.2 Hz) such that the surgeon may even purely rely on the OCT for certain surgical maneuvers. It represents a major technological step towards the possible application of OCT-only surgical microscopes in the future which would be much more compact thus enabling many additional minimal invasive applications. We show that multi-MHz A-scan rates are essential for such a device. Additionally, advanced phase-based OCT techniques require 3D OCT volumes to be detected with a stable optical phase. These techniques can provide additional functional information of the retina. Up to now, classical OCT was to slow for this, so our system can pave the way to holographic OCT with a traditional confocal flying spot approach. For the first time, we present point scanning volumetric OCT imaging of the posterior eye with up to 191.2 Hz volume rate. We show that this volume rate is high enough to enable a sufficiently stable optical phase to a level, where remaining phase errors can be corrected. Applying advanced post processing concepts for numerical refocusing or computational adaptive optics should be possible in future with such a system. \textcopyright{} 2019 Kolb et al.

Both FM and IS are compared quantitatively with sub-aperture based digital adaptive optics (DAO). FM has the least numerical complexity, and is the fastest in terms of computational speed among the three. SNR improvement of more than 10 dB is shown for all the three methods over a sample depth of 1.5 mm. For a sample with non-uniform refractive index with depth, FM and IS both improved the depth of focus (DOF) by a factor of 7x for an imaging NA of 0.1. DAO performs the best in case of non-uniform refractive index with respect to DOF improvement by 11x.},

Using this method, a sub-micron lateral resolution is achieved over a depth range of 218{$\mu$}mfor a nano-particle phantom sample imaged using a fiber based point scanning spectral domain (SD) OCM system with a limited depth of focus (DOF) of  7{$\mu$}mat a numerical aperture (NA) of 0. 6.

Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) is an optical computed-imaging technique, which can make transverse resolutions at the different depths identical by resampling the spectrum data. The procedure of ISAM and the principle of error were analyzed and a reconstruction model of multi-scatterers is established. The multiple scatterers simulation is implemented by use of ISAM compared with the standard OCT methods. The approximate wavenumber domain algorithm is applied in ISAM, which can save much rebuilding time without the Stolt interpolation and the spectral OCT experiment system was developed. The experimental results showed that it can greatly reduce computational complexity to enhance the performance of real-time, which costs 50 s to finish one 320 pixel\texttimes 265 pixel image.},

The method utilizes a scalar diffraction model to simulate wave propagation from out-of-focus scatter to the focal plane, from which the propagation distance between the out-of-focus plane and the focal plane is determined automatically via an image-definition-evaluation criterion based on information entropy theory. By use of the proposed approach, we demonstrate that the lateral resolution close to that at the focal plane can be recovered from the imaging planes outside the depth of field region with minimal loss of resolution. Fresh onion tissues and mouse fat tissues are used in the experiments to show the performance of the proposed method.},

Optical coherence microscopy (OCM) is a low-coherence-based interferometry technology for cellular imaging with both high axial and lateral resolution. Using a high-numerical-aperture objective, OCM normally has a shallow depth of field and requires scanning the focus through the entire region of interest to perform volumetric imaging. With a higher-numerical-aperture objective, the image quality of OCM is affected by and more sensitive to aberrations. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) and computational adaptive optics (CAO) are computed imaging techniques that overcome the depth-of-field limitation and the effect of optical aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively. In this work we combine OCM with ISAM and CAO to achieve high-speed volumetric cellular imaging. Experimental imaging results of ex vivo human breast tissue, ex vivo mouse brain tissue, in vitro fibroblast cells in 3D scaffolds, and in vivo human skin demonstrate the significant potential of this technique for high-speed volumetric cellular imaging. \textcopyright{} 2014 Optical Society of America.},

By solving the inverse scattering problem for full-field OCT, we show it is possible to computationally reconstruct a three-dimensional volume while the focus is fixed at one plane inside the sample. While a low-numerical-aperture (NA) OCT system can tolerate defocus because the depth of field is large, for high NA it is critical to correct for defocus. By deriving a solution to the inverse scattering problem for full-field OCT, we propose and simulate an algorithm that recovers object structure both inside and outside the depth of field, so that even for high NA the focus can be fixed at a particular plane within the sample without compromising resolution away from the focal plane.},

In this work, we develop an iterative statistical reconstruction technique, based upon the interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) model with additive noise, to actively compensate for these effects. For the ISAM re-sampling, we use a non uniform FFT with Kaiser-Bessel interpolation, offering efficiency and high accuracy. We then employ an accelerated gradient descent based algorithm, to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the model, and include spatial or wavelet sparsity based penalty functions, to provide appropriate regularization for given image structures. We evaluate our approach with titanium oxide micro-bead and cucumber samples with a commercial spectral domain OCT system, under various subsampling regimes, and demonstrate superior image quality over traditional reconstruction and ISAM methods. \textcopyright{} 2019 SPIE.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence elastography allows the characterization of the mechanical properties of tissues, and can be performed through estimating local displacement maps from subsequent acquisitions of a sample under different loads. This displacement estimation is limited by noise in the images, which can be high in dynamic systems due to the inability to perform long exposures or B-scan averaging. In this work, we propose a framework for simultaneously enhancing both the image quality and displacement map for elastography, by motion compensated denoising with the block-matching and 4D filtering (BM4D) method, followed by a re-estimation of displacement. We adopt the interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) method to enhance the lateral resolution away from the focal plane, and use sub-pixel cross correlation block matching for non-uniform deformation estimation. We validate this approach on data from a commercial spectral domain optical coherence tomography system, whereby we observe an enhancement of both image and displacement accuracy of up to 33\% over a standard approach. \textcopyright{} 2019 SPIE.},

  abstract = {A full-wave model for simulating images in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) with rigorous accounting for the beam-focusing effects is developed. Due to the analytical description of beam focusing, the model is computationally rather efficient. It also uses a rigorous numerical summation of the contributions of the localized sub-resolution scatterers, accounting for variations in the phase-amplitude parameters of the incident and backscattered optical waves, with a subsequent integration of the latter over the objective aperture. In the limit of a weakly focused beam, the developed model has allowed for the validatation of the earlier proposed simplified model with a constant-radius beam. It is shown that, for weakly focused beams, utilization of the computationally more efficient simplified model is quite sufficient, especially when simulation of numerous OCT scans in tissues with moving scatterers is necessary. The relevant examples related to the OCT imaging of spatially inhomogeneous strains are given. When the application of strongly focused beams is indispensable to obtain ultimately high resolution in OCT scans, the developed rigorous model for strongly focused beams offers convenient possibilities for developing methods of numerical refocusing. Possibilities to ensure uniform, close-to-maximal resolution not only in the focus waist, but over the entire imaged depth range, are demonstrated in simulations based on the developed model. \textcopyright{} 2019 Astro Ltd.},

  abstract = {Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) utilizes a high NA microscope objective in the sample arm to achieve an axially and laterally high resolution OCT image. An increase in NA, however, leads to a dramatically decreased depth of focus (DOF), and hence shortens the imaging depth range so that high lateral resolution is maintained only within a small depth region around the focal plane. One solution to increase the depth of imaging while keeping a high lateral resolution is dynamic-focusing. Utilizing the voltage controlled refocus capability of a liquid lens, we have recently presented a solution for invariant high resolution imaging using the liquid lens embedded within a fixed optics hand-held custom microscope designed specifically for optical imaging systems using a broadband light source at 800 nm center wavelength. Subsequently, we have developed a Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GD-OCM) that utilizes the high speed imaging of spectral domain OCT, the high lateral resolution of OCM, and the ability of real time refocusing of our custom design variable focus objective. In this paper we demonstrate in detail how portions of the infocus cross-sectional images can be extracted and fused to form an invariant lateral resolution image with multiple crosssectional images acquired corresponding to a discrete refocusing step along depth enabled by the varifocal probe. We demonstrate sub-cellular resolution imaging of an African frog tadpole (Xenopus Laevis) taken from a 500 {$\mu$}m x 500 {$\mu$}m cross-section. \textcopyright{} 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

  abstract = {We propose the digital holographic technique that can mathematically reconstruct the distorted two dimensional en-face images obtained with full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT). As a powerful biomedical imaging modality, FF-OCT provides inner microstructure images of a biological sample noninvasively but with a submicron depth resolution. The main advantage of the FF-OCT over other OCT techniques is that, it requires only depth scanning (C-scan) without any transverse mechanical scanning (B-scan). In a FF-OCT system based on a Michelson interferometer, not only the length of the reference arm should be matched with the length to the imaging plane in the sample arms, but also the focal plane of the system should be matched with the imaging plane. When the sample has a very high refractive index than the surrounding medium, in which the reference mirror is immersed, the mismatch between the imaging plane and the focusing plane becomes a severe problem and results in degradation of OCT image. In this study, we confirm the existence of the imaging and focusing plane mismatch problem in the FF-OCT system, and propose the method that can retrieve the focused image from a defocused image with the help of digital holography. One of the major advantages of the proposed technique is that it does not require any mechanical movement for refocusing. Only numerical calculation based on the Fresnel diffraction theory is enough. The performance is demonstrated with the image of the USAF resolution target. The image of the chromium coated pattern on the target was blurred with the existence of the glass substrate, when the OCT image was taken through the substrate. The blurred image was digitally corrected to get on the focused clear image of the pattern. \textcopyright{} 2011 SPIE.},

The en-face FF-OCT image on an inner layer boundary of a multilayered sample is unintentionally blurred or defocused due to the RI of the sample itself, but can be numerically refocused. The refocusing is performed by numerically shifting the image sensor plane of the system, in general. However, by calculating the corresponding sample shift and then compared it with the actual sample shifting distance, we could extract the average RI of the layer between any two layer boundaries within the multilayered sample. In addition, the thickness of that particular layer could be derived at the same time. For the idea proof, several samples were prepared by stacking, for each sample, two transparent plates with a gap in between. While changing the material of the plate and filling the gap with oil, the RIs of the plate and the oil were measured. For oils of various RIs, from 1.2977 to 1.3857, the measured RIs were well matched with the reported ones within 0.205\%. Moreover, even with a stack of various and multiple plates in front of the same oil layer, the oil RI and the physical thickness of the oil layer were extracted with average errors of only 0.065\% and 0.990\%, respectively. \textcopyright{} 2013 Optical Society of America.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method to extend the depth-of-focus of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT is an interferometric imaging technique that provides depth-resolved scattering information. The axial resolution in OCT is provided by the coherence gate and is invariant over the full image depth. The lateral resolution is determined by the beam parameters such as wavelength and numerical aperture. The Rayleigh range determines the depth range over which the lateral resolution can be maintained. The lateral resolution is often sacrificed to maintain relatively long Rayleigh range. In this study, we propose to use a depth-encoded synthetic aperture detection scheme to extend the depth range over which a sharp focus can be maintained beyond the Rayleigh range. An annular phase plate is inserted into the light path in the sample arm, which gives rise to three separate images in a single B-scan, corresponding to three different optical path length encoded apertures. These three images are coherently summed after phase-manipulation to reconstruct a new image with a lateral resolution that is maintained over a five times larger depth range. \textcopyright{} 2013 Optical Society of America.},

Although refocusing itself depends on the refractive index of the studied media, we propose a procedure capable of restoring images with resolution equal to the resolution in the focal plane in the whole volume even in case of unknown refractive index of the media. As the proposed refocusing method operates with phases of the 3D Fourier spectrum of the SD OCT signal, it is very sensitive to the object motion during data acquisition.

Since several OCT images with the focal plane in various positions can be fused into one image with increased lateral resolution, such a filter facilitates the creation of an OCT system with numerically increased lateral resolution, operating in real-time, i.e. showing one OCT B-scan with increased lateral resolution while collecting data for the next B-scan. Since the proposed real-time resolution enhancement method is phase-sensitive, the method for estimating and compensating phase shifts between consecutive B-scans during data acquisition is also discussed. \textcopyright{} 2018 Astro Ltd.},

  abstract = {Among the numerous methods for improving the informative value of the optical coherence tomography (OCT), a special place is taken by the methods for increasing the spatial resolution of the resulting images. Increasing the resolution allows one to identify more clinically significant structures in OCT images and thus improve the diagnostic value of OCT. Since the transverse resolution of OCT images is determined by the physical principles different from those for the longitudinal resolution, the ways of their improvement are also different. The aim of the study is to develop a method for increasing the transverse resolution of OCT by using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter for numerical refocusing and by combining the numerically refocused images. Results. We have developed a FIR filter able to transfer the focal plane of an OCT image using the data from 17 consecutive measurements of the field scattered by the object. In addition, we propose an original method for automatic synthesis of the final OCT image with an improved transverse resolution over the entire object depth from a series of images having different focal plane positions. This will enable the OCT instrument to produce a sharply focused beam for the scanning and thus obtain images with an improved transverse resolution in the focal plane, restore the required resolution in the out-of-focus areas using numerical transfer of the focal plane, and also synthesize the final OCT image with an improved transverse resolution. The method has been tested with model objects using an OCT device operating at a central wavelength of 1 {$\mu$}m with the 60 nm range and a beam focused onto a spot with a diameter of 5 {$\mu$}m. Conclusion. The proposed method of numerically increasing the transverse resolution of OCT images allows one to obtain images with an improved transverse resolution using only a small number of OCT measurements; in the future, it will allow for creating an OCT device that produces high-resolution images in real time. \textcopyright{} 2019, Privolzhsky Research Medical University.

By utilizing the digital hologram method or angular spectrum method, the blurred image can be refocused. However, for in vivo OCT imaging, evaluation of the image focus is not easy, owing to the cloudy structure of the brain. In the proposed method, the blood flow signals were used as a guiding star to find the recovery factor. The propagation distance to a focal plane was automatically determined by evaluating the contrast of a cross-sectional OCTA image. The performance was examined though in vivo mouse brain OCT/OCTA imaging. The image singularity of the blood flow in OCTA was very effective at evaluating the contrast of the image.},

  abstract = {In vivo imaging of the human retina with a resolution that allows visualization of cellular structures has proven to be essential to broaden our knowledge about the physiology of this precious and very complex neural tissue that enables the first steps in vision. Many pathologic changes originate from functional and structural alterations on a cellular scale, long before any degradation in vision can be noted. Therefore, it is important to investigate these tissues with a sufficient level of detail in order to better understand associated disease development or the effects of therapeutic intervention. Optical retinal imaging modalities rely on the optical elements of the eye itself (mainly the cornea and lens) to produce retinal images and are therefore affected by the specific arrangement of these elements and possible imperfections in curvature. Thus, aberrations are introduced to the imaging light and image quality is degraded. To compensate for these aberrations, adaptive optics (AO), a technology initially developed in astronomy, has been utilized. However, the axial sectioning provided by retinal AO-based fundus cameras and scanning laser ophthalmoscope instruments is limited to tens of micrometers because of the rather small available numerical aperture of the eye. To overcome this limitation and thus achieve much higher axial sectioning in the order of 2-5{$\mu$}m, AO has been combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) into AO-OCT. This enabled for the first time in vivo volumetric retinal imaging with high isotropic resolution. This article summarizes the technical aspects of AO-OCT and provides an overview on its various implementations and some of its clinical applications. In addition, latest developments in the field, such as computational AO-OCT and wavefront sensor less AO-OCT, are covered. \textcopyright{} 2017 Optical Society of America.},

  abstract = {Imaging resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a key determinant for acquiring clinically useful optical biopsies of tissues. In contrast to light or confocal microscopy, the axial and transverse resolutions in OCT are independent and each can be analyzed individually. A method for mitigating transverse blurring and the apparent loss of transverse resolution in OCT by means of Gaussian beam deconvolution is presented. Such a method provides better representation of a specimen by using known physical parameters of a lens. To implement this method, deconvolution algorithms based on a focal-dependent kernel are investigated. First, the direct inverse problem is investigated using two types of regularization, truncated singular value decomposition, and Tikhonov. Second, an iterative expectation maximization algorithm, the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, with a beam-width-dependent iteration scheme is developed. A dynamically iterative Richardson-Lucy algorithm can reduce transverse blurring by providing an improvement in the transverse point-spread-function for sparse scattering samples in regions up to two times larger than the confocal region of the lens. These deblurring improvements inside and outside of the confocal region, which are validated experimentally, are possible without introducing new optical imaging hardware or acquiring multiple images of the same specimen. Implementation of this method in sparse scattering specimens, such as engineered tissues, has the potential to improve cellular detection and categorization. \textcopyright{} 2005 IEEE.},

ISAM has increased the resolution achievable from an OCT signal outside of the confocal parameter of the focusing lens by exploiting the previously undecipherable out-of-focus data within the conventional OCT imaging scheme. The reconstruction algorithm may be implemented for either cross-sectional images or full 3D volumes, and, because of the modest computational complexity of this technique.

Here we show that, by solving the inverse scattering problem for interference microscopy, computed reconstruction yields volumes with a resolution in all planes that is equivalent to the resolution achieved only at the focal plane for conventional high-resolution microscopy. In short, the entire illuminated volume has spatially invariant resolution, thus eliminating the compromise between resolution and depth of field. We describe and demonstrate a novel computational image-formation technique called interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM). ISAM has the potential to broadly impact real-time three-dimensional microscopy and analysis in the fields of cell and tumour biology, as well as in clinical diagnosis where in vivo imaging is preferable to biopsy.},

  abstract = {The transition of optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology from the lab environment towards the more challenging clinical and point-of-care settings is continuing at a rapid pace. On one hand this translation opens new opportunities and avenues for growth, while on the other hand it also presents a new set of challenges and constraints under which OCT systems have to operate. OCT systems in the clinical environment are not only required to be user friendly and easy to operate, but should also be portable, have a smaller form factor coupled with low cost and reduced power consumption. Digital signal processors (DSP) are in a unique position to satisfy the computational requirements for OCT at a much lower cost and power consumption compared to the existing platforms such as CPU and graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we describe the implementation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) processing on a floating point multi-core DSP (C6678, Texas Instruments). ISAM is a computationally intensive data processing technique that is based on the re-sampling of the Fourier space of the data to yield spatially invariant transverse resolution in OCT. Preliminary results indicate that 2DISAM processing at 70,000 A-lines/sec and OCT at 180,000 A-lines/sec can be achieved with the current implementation using available DSP hardware. \textcopyright{} 2013 Copyright SPIE.},

While a great deal of insight can be gained by understanding OCT intuitively as a range-finding mechanism, more sophisticated analysis can reveal additional detail and features to the extent data quality allows. To maximize the utility of the data, signal processing is used to reject noise and to ensure the resulting image conforms to known properties of the object. We briefly summarize concepts of inference in signal processing. These ideas are applied when reviewing and examining methods of reducing noise, improving resolution through deconvolution, reducing speckle, correcting for material dispersion and OCT system imperfections, and deblurring the defocusing effects outside of the depth-of-field of the OCT instrument. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) utilizes a high NA microscope objective in the sample arm to achieve an axially and laterally high resolution OCT image. An increase in NA, however, leads to a dramatically decreased depth of focus (DOF), and hence shortens the imaging depth range so that high lateral resolution is maintained only within a small depth region around the focal plane. One solution to increase the depth of imaging while keeping a high lateral resolution is dynamic-focusing. Utilizing the voltage controlled refocus capability of a liquid lens, we have recently presented a solution for invariant high resolution imaging using the liquid lens embedded within a fixed optics hand-held custom microscope designed specifically for optical imaging systems using a broadband light source centered at 800 nm with a 120 nm bandwidth. Subsequently, we have developed a Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GD-OCM) that utilizes the high speed imaging of spectral domain OCT, the high lateral resolution of OCM, and the ability of real time refocusing of our custom design variable focus objective. Finally, key developments in Phase-Resolved Doppler OCT (PR-DOCT) are key enablers to combine high-resolution structural imaging with functional imaging. In this paper we review achievements in GD-OCM and detail how portions of in-focus cross-sectional images can be extracted and fused to form an invariant lateral resolution image with multiple cross-sectional images acquired corresponding to a discrete refocusing step along depth enabled by the varifocal device. We demonstrate sub-cellular resolution imaging of an African frog tadpole (Xenopus Laevis) taken from a 500 {$\mu$}m \texttimes{} 500 {$\mu$}m cross-section as well as cellular imaging in in vivo skin. Finally, A novel dual-detection full-range Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography system was developed that provides 7 {$\mu$}m axial resolution (in air) at about 90 kHz axial scan rate for mirror-image phase resolved Doppler imaging in an African frog tadpole and an in vivo human finger. \textcopyright{} 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

The computing power available in the modern desktop computer provides the means to process large data sets with the complexity needed to implement fast Fourier transform (FFT) and interpolate data. The average point-spread function with a phantom of sub-resolution-sized particles for Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ISAM can be measured. ISAM enables the development of a small-form-factor instrument that has a fixed focal plane and high resolution but large depth-of-field limited only by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The instrument could greatly expand the reach of low-coherence optical imaging in medicine. ISAM offers an in situ view of high-resolution cell and tissue microstructure over larger volumes in order to reduce re-operation rates.},

AOSLO videos with active eyetracking signals showed, at most, an amplitude of motion of 0.20 arcminutes for horizontal motion and 0.14 arcminutes for vertical motion. Subsequent real-time digital stabilization limited residual motion to an average of only 0.06 arcminutes (a 95\% reduction). By correcting for high amplitude, low frequency drifts of the eye, the active TSLO eye-tracking system enabled the AOSLO system to capture high-resolution retinal images over a larger range of motion than previously possible with just the AOSLO imaging system alone. \textcopyright{} 2015, Optical Society of America.},

Overcoming these challenges has attracted many hardware and computational solutions. Hardware solutions, though, can become bulky or expensive and computational approaches can require high computing power or large processing times. This study demonstrates memory efficient implementations of interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) and computational adaptive optics (CAO) - two computational approaches for overcoming the depthof- field limitation and the effect of optical aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT). Traditionally requiring lengthy post processing, here we report implementations of ISAM and CAO on a single GPU for real-time in vivo imaging. Real-time, camera-limited ISAM processing enabled reliable acquisition of stable data for in vivo imaging, and CAO processing on the same GPU is shown to quickly correct static aberrations. These algorithmic advances hold the promise for high-resolution volumetric imaging in time-sensitive situations as well as enabling aberrationfree cellular-level volumetric tomography.},

In Doppler optical coherence tomography and optical coherence elastography, in addition to defocus and aberration correction techniques such as interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy and computational/digital adaptive optics, a precise understanding of the system and sample stability helps to guide the system design and choice of imaging parameters. This article focuses on methods to accurately and quantitatively measure the stability of an imaging configuration in vivo.

  abstract = {We demonstrate high-resolution imaging of the living human retina by computationally correcting highorder ocular aberrations. These corrections are performed post-Acquisition and without the need for a deformable mirror or wavefront sensor that are commonly employed in hardware adaptive optics (HAO) systems. With the introduction of HAO to ophthalmic imaging, high-resolution near diffraction-limited imaging of the living human retina has become possible. The combination of a deformable mirror, wavefront sensor, and supporting hardware/software, though, can more than double the cost of the underlying imaging modality, in addition to significantly increasing the system complexity and sensitivity to misalignment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows 3-D imaging in addition to naturally providing the complex optical field of backscattered light. This is unlike a scanning laser ophthalmoscope which measures only the intensity of the backscattered light. Previously, our group has demonstrated the utility of a technique called computational adaptive optics (CAO) which utilizes the complex field measured with OCT to computationally correct for optical aberrations in a manner similar to HAO. Until now, CAO has been applied to ex vivo imaging and in vivo skin imaging. Here, we demonstrate in vivo imaging of cone photoreceptors using CAO. Additional practical considerations such as imaging speed, and stability are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2015 SPIE.},

The introduction of hardware-based adaptive optics (HAO) has pushed the limits of optical imaging, enabling high-resolution near diffraction-limited imaging of previously unresolvable structures. In ophthalmology, when combined with optical coherence tomography, HAO has enabled a detailed three-dimensional visualization of photoreceptor distributions and individual nerve fibre bundles in the living human retina. However, the introduction of HAO hardware and supporting software adds considerable complexity and cost to an imaging system, limiting the number of researchers and medical professionals who could benefit from the technology. Here we demonstrate a fully automated computational approach that enables high-resolution in vivo ophthalmic imaging without the need for HAO. The results demonstrate that computational methods in coherent microscopy are applicable in highly dynamic living systems. \textcopyright{} 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Previously, hardware adaptive optics (HAO) has been employed to measure and correct these aberrations to acquire high-resolution images of various retinal structures. While the resulting aberration-corrected images are of great clinical importance, clinical use of HAO has not been widespread due to the cost and complexity of these systems. We present a technique termed computational adaptive optics (CAO) for aberration correction in the living human retina without the use of hardware adaptive optics components. In CAO, complex interferometric data acquired using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is manipulated in post-processing to adjust the phase of the optical wavefront. In this way, the aberrated wavefront can be corrected. We summarize recent results in this technology for retinal imaging, including aberration-corrected imaging in multiple retinal layers and practical considerations such as phase stability and image optimization. \textcopyright{} 2016 SPIE.},

Computed optical interferometric imaging is able to overcome these longstanding limitations using methods such as interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) and computational adaptive optics (CAO), which manipulate the complex interferometric data. These techniques correct for limited depth-of-field and optical aberrations without the need for additional hardware. This paper aims to outline these computational methods, making them readily available to the research community. Achievements of the techniques will be highlighted, along with past and present challenges in implementing the techniques. Challenges such as phase instability and determination of the appropriate aberration correction have been largely overcome so that imaging of living tissues using ISAM and CAO is now possible. Computed imaging in optics is becoming a mature technology poised to make a significant impact in medicine and biology. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In many optical imaging applications, it is necessary to overcome aberrations to obtain high-resolution images. Aberration correction can be performed by either physically modifying the optical wavefront using hardware components, or by modifying the wavefront during image reconstruction using computational imaging. Here we address a longstanding issue in computational imaging: photons that are not collected cannot be corrected. This severely restricts the applications of computational wavefront correction. Additionally, performance limitations of hardware wavefront correction leave many aberrations uncorrected. We combine hardware and computational correction to address the shortcomings of each method. Coherent optical backscattering data is collected using high-speed optical coherence tomography, with aberrations corrected at the time of acquisition using a wavefront sensor and deformable mirror to maximize photon collection. Remaining aberrations are corrected by digitally modifying the coherently-measured wavefront during imaging reconstruction. This strategy obtains high-resolution images with improved signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo human photoreceptor cells with more complete correction of ocular aberrations, and increased flexibility to image at multiple retinal depths, field locations, and time points. While our approach is not restricted to retinal imaging, this application is one of the most challenging for computational imaging due to the large aberrations of the dilated pupil, time-varying aberrations, and unavoidable eye motion. In contrast with previous computational imaging work, we have imaged single photoreceptors and their waveguide modes in fully dilated eyes with a single acquisition. Combined hardware and computational wavefront correction improves the image sharpness of existing adaptive optics systems, and broadens the potential applications of computational imaging methods. \textcopyright{} 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.},

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides access to the amplitude and phase of the backscattered optical field for three-dimensional (3D) imaging samples. Computational adaptive optics (CAO) modifies the phase of the OCT data in the spatial frequency domain to correct optical aberrations without using a deformable mirror, as is commonly done in hardware-based adaptive optics (AO). This provides improvement of image quality throughout the 3D volume, enabling imaging across greater depth ranges and in highly aberrated samples. However, the CAO aberration correction has a complicated relation to the imaging pupil and is not a direct measurement of the pupil aberrations. Here we present new methods for recovering the wavefront aberrations directly from the OCT data without the use of hardware adaptive optics.

Measuring the localized wavefront aberration provides information on where the beam is distorted and how severely. We have recently developed a method to estimate the single-pass wavefront aberrations from complex optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. Using this method, localized wavefront measurement and correction using computational OCT was performed in ex vivo tissues. The computationally measured wavefront varied throughout the imaged OCT volumes and, therefore, a local wavefront correction outperformed a global wavefront correction. The local wavefront measurement was also used to generate tissue aberration maps. Such aberration maps could potentially be used as a new form of tissue contrast. \textcopyright{} 2019 Optical Society of America},

  abstract = {Frequency domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) achieves high image acquisition speeds by probing all depths of a sample simultaneously. However, the tightly focused beam required for frequency domain optical coherence microscopy (FD-OCM) produces images with poor lateral resolution at depths away from the beam waist. The new technique of interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) can digitally focus these poorly resolved FD-OCM images, resulting in uniform lateral resolution throughout the sample volume equivalent to that in the plane of focus of the incident beam. While ISAM is computationally intensive, we demonstrate that an ISAM implementation using Nvidia\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s parallel Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) can achieve real-time focusing using a mid-range Nvidia GPU. The time required for digital focusing scales linearly with image size, at a rate of about 10 nanoseconds per voxel. This makes possible real-time FD-OCM. For example, a 3-D image (512 x 512 x 128 voxels) with crosssection 1.2 mm x 1.2 mm and 200 micron depth requires 17 seconds to acquire with a 100 kHz A-scan rate (and 6 repeated x-scans for motion sensitivity), but only 360 milliseconds to focus with ISAM. This example image is simulated with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.07, so that the 200 micron depth represents four Rayleigh ranges ({$\pm$} 2 Rayleigh ranges from the focal plane). In addition, our simulations indicate that ISAM performs well with very noisy input data. Even with noise levels as high as 50\%, ISAM produces focused images with signal-to-noise ratios of over 100. ISAM-focusing is both fast and robust.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that measures reflectance from within biological tissues. Current higher-NA optical coherence microscopy (OCM) technologies with near cellular resolution have limitations on volumetric imaging capabilities due to the trade-offs between resolution vs. depth-of-field and sensitivity to aberrations. Such trade-offs can be addressed using computational adaptive optics (CAO), which corrects aberration computationally for all depths based on the complex optical field measured by OCT. However, due to the large size of datasets plus the computational complexity of CAO and OCT algorithms, it is a challenge to achieve high-resolution 3D-OCM reconstructions at speeds suitable for clinical and research OCM imaging. In recent years, real-time OCT reconstruction incorporating both dispersion and defocus correction has been achieved through parallel computing on graphics processing units (GPUs). We add to these methods by implementing depth-dependent aberration correction for volumetric OCM using plane-by-plane phase deconvolution. Following both defocus and aberration correction, our reconstruction algorithm achieved depth-independent transverse resolution of 2.8 um, equal to the diffraction-limited focal plane resolution. We have translated the CAO algorithm to a CUDA code implementation and tested the speed of the software in real-time using two GPUs-NVIDIA Quadro K600 and Geforce TITAN Z. For a data volume containing 4096\texttimes 256\texttimes 256 voxels, our system's processing speed can keep up with the 60 kHz acquisition rate of the line-scan camera, and takes 1.09 seconds to simultaneously update the CAO correction for 3 en face planes at user-selectable depths. \textcopyright{} 2016 SPIE.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that provides cross-sectional images from microstructures of tissues. This optical imaging system works based on Michelson interferometry principle and has intermediate resolution and penetration depth which makes it appropriate for imaging thin tissues such as skin and eye. OCT images suffer from three main artifacts that make images difficult to be analyzed. The first one is small grainy structures called speckle which degrade image quality and decreases axial and lateral resolution. The second one is light intensity attenuation which is a function of depth. It happens because of absorbing and scattering nature of tissue which causes loss of information especially in the deeper parts of images. The third artifact is blurriness of image which is because of limitation in imaging electronic hardware and some other imaging limitation. This artifact also decrease image resolution and destroys image sharpness. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical image enhancement procedure in order to remove these artifacts and make OCT images more comprehensible and useful for physicians. This procedure contains attenuation compensation, image deblurring, and speckle reduction. The results show that high level of improvement after each enhancement step, qualitatively and quantitatively can be reached. SNR and CNR of enhanced image are increased about 3 and 4 times, respectively. \textcopyright{} 2017 IEEE.},

The ocular aberrations were corrected using a multi-actuator adaptive lens after linearization of the hysteresis in the piezoelectric actuators. The DONE algorithm succeeded in drastically improving image quality and the OCT signal intensity, up to a factor seven, while achieving a computational time of 1 ms per iteration, making it applicable for many high speed applications. We demonstrate the correction of five aberrations using 70 iterations of the DONE algorithm performed over 2.8 s of continuous volumetric OCT acquisition.

Due to the noises, the boundaries between the different organizations in the early embryo are ambiguous, which would cause interference of organization segmentation. To solve this problem, this paper processed full-field OCT images of early embryos with the median filter, wiener filter and anisotropic diffusion algorithm, and evaluated the noise reduction effect using the signal-to-noise ratio, the mean square error, peak signal to noise ratio and edge retention index. It was shown that early embryo images after noise reduction with anisotropic diffusion algorithm kept most of the original information with relatively clear boundaries. Therefore, anisotropic diffusion algorithm is suggested to be the best denoising method for FF-OCT imaging in terms of the visual effect. \textcopyright{} 2018 Institute of BiophysicsChinese Academy of Sciences.

However, the cellular resolution level information that is critical for many clinical applications is still not available. The major technical challenges toward cellular resolution OCT imaging are the limited ranging depth and depth of focus (DOF). In this work, we present a novel ultrahigh resolution OCT system that achieves an isotropic spatial resolution of \textexclamdown 2 \textmu m in tissue. The proposed system could approximately double the ranging depth and extend the DOF using the dual-spectrometer design and the forward-model based digital refocusing method, respectively. We demonstrate that the novel system is capable of visualizing the full thickness of the pig cornea over the ranging depth of 3.5 mm and the border of the corneal endothelial cells 8 times Rayleigh range away from the focal plane. This technology has the potential to realize cellular resolution corneal imaging in vivo. \textcopyright{} 2019 Optical Society of America.},

Bulk motion associated phase shift can be directly derived by solving its equation using a standard deviation of phase-based OCTA and Doppler OCT flow signals. This method was evaluated on rodent retinal images acquired by a prototype visible light OCT and human retinal images acquired by a commercial system. The image quality and computational speed were significantly improved, compared to two conventional phase compensation methods. \textcopyright{} 2018 Optical Society of America.},

However, image blurring can be introduced into the OCT images during the image acquirement process, resulted from the movement of eye or the out-of-focus effect of the imaging machine. Therefore, OCT image deblurring is of great importance in practice. In this paper, we use an expectation-maximization (EM) based image deconvolution technique for eliminating the blur effect in the OCT images. The proposed technique is designed based on several of the special characteristics of the OCT retinal image and is validated to be able to outperform various state-of-the-art image deblurring techniques as shown by the experimental results in the paper. \textcopyright{} 2018 by Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing.},

This method uses a depth-dependent lateral point spread function and some approximations to design a deconvolution filter for the cancellation of lateral defocus. Improved lateral resolutions are theoretically estimated; consequently, the effect of lateral superresolution in this method is derived. The superresolution is experimentally confirmed by a razor blade test, and an intuitive physical interpretation of this effect is presented. The razor blade test also confirms that this method enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of OCT. This method is applied to OCT images of medical samples, in vivo human anterior eye segments, and exhibits its potential to cancel the defocusing of practical OCT images. The validity and restrictions involved in each approximation employed to design the deconvolution filter are discussed. A chromatic and a two-dimensional extensions of this method are also described.},

  abstract = {Combining the advantages of compressive sensing spectral domain optical coherence tomography (CS-SDOCT) and interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) in terms of data volume, imaging speed, and lateral resolution, we demonstrated how compressive sampling and ISAM can be simultaneously used to reconstruct an optical coherence tomography (OCT) image. Specifically, an OCT image is reconstructed from two-dimensional (2D) under-sampled spectral data dimension-by-dimension through a CS reconstruction algorithm. During the iterative process of CS algorithm, the deterioration of lateral resolution beyond the depth of focus (DOF) of a Gaussian beam is corrected. In the end, with less spectral data, we can obtain an OCT image with spatially invariant lateral resolution throughout the imaging depth. This method was verified in this paper by imaging the cells of an orange. A 0.7 \texttimes{} 1.5 mm image of an orange was reconstructed using only 50\% \texttimes{} 50\% spectral data, in which the dispersion of the structure was decreased by approximately 2.4 times at a depth of approximately 5.7 Rayleigh ranges above the focus. This result was consistent with that obtained with 100\% data. \textcopyright{} 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to single-image super-resolution in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Retinal OCT images can be used to diagnose various diseases, not only peculiar to the eye, but also some systemic diseases. Nevertheless, as with any imaging modality, the acquired images suffer from degradation due to various causes. To overcome this and enhance image quality, Super-Resolution (SR) techniques are widely used. This work explores a convex regularization approach based on a multivariate generalization of the minimax-concave (GMC) scheme in a forward-backward splitting (FBS) scheme. Based on the assumption that sparse representations of OCT images are heavy-tailed, an {$\alpha$}-stable dictionary is employed. This approach is implemented with overlapping and non-overlapping patches. Since the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the images used is generally unknown, it is estimated using a method originally proposed for ultrasound images. The algorithm is tested on OCT images of murine eyes. The results show that the proposed convex regularization method provides results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Indeed, significant deblurring and quality enhancement are achieved using the proposed algorithm and in most cases it provides the best results, both objectively and subjectively. \textcopyright{} 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) system, we can get high transverse resolution only within the focal depth field. The transverse resolution degrades away from the focal plane. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) is a three-dimensional image reconstruction algorithm, which can make the out-of-focus image clearer, and a resolution in all planes that is equivalent to the resolution at the focal plane can be obtained. At the same time, the contradiction between the transverse resolution and the imaging depth in the SDOCT system can be solved. The principle of ISAM and its possible applications are introduced and the comparison between the reconstructed images by the traditional SDOCT method and the ISAM is performed. The nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm is applied in ISAM. Experimental results show that the NUFFT can greatly reduce the operation time, improving the performance of real-time and high-resolution SDOCT system. \textcopyright{} 2017, Chinese Lasers Press.

  abstract = {Background: A multicenter, prospective, blinded study was performed to test the feasibility of using a handheld optical imaging probe for the intraoperative assessment of final surgical margins during breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and to determine the potential impact on patient outcomes. Methods: Forty-six patients with early-stage breast cancer (one with bilateral disease) undergoing BCS at two study sites, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Anne Arundel Medical Center, were enrolled in this study. During BCS, cavity-shaved margins were obtained and the final margins were examined ex vivo in the operating room with a probe incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) hardware and interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) image processing. Images were interpreted after BCS by three physicians blinded to final pathology-reported margin status. Individual and combined interpretations were assessed. Results were compared to conventional postoperative histopathology. Results: A total of 2,191 images were collected and interpreted from 229 shave margin specimens. Of the eight patients (17 \%) with positive margins (0 mm), which included invasive and in situ diseases, the device identified all positive margins in five (63 \%) of them; reoperation could potentially have been avoided in these patients. Among patients with pathologically negative margins (\textquestiondown 0 mm), an estimated mean additional tissue volume of 10.7 ml (approximately 1 \% of overall breast volume) would have been unnecessarily removed due to false positives. Conclusions: Intraoperative optical imaging of specimen margins with a handheld probe potentially eliminates the majority of reoperations. \textcopyright{} 2015, Society of Surgical Oncology.},
