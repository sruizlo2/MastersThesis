\chapter{Introduction}

Light-matter interaction have become an important tool in medical sciences and biology, leading to the creation and development of a specialized field known as \textit{biomedical optics} or \textit{biophotonics} oriented to fundamental research, surgery assistance and imaging, diagnosis, therapy and monitory of diseases~\cite{}. Many imaging techniques have emerged in biomedical optics, in particular, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
